## Part 2

Looping through all the games to find the max of each colour in each of the rounds. Not too bad today, just loops within loops and a bit of parsing. I'm trying the 'nom' library for parsing. It might be a bit more flexible that regex when we get too more complicated stuff later down the line so it's probably worth learning now.
