# Day 3: Gear Ratios

## Part 1

I looped through all the weird symbols and created an adjacency area of all the positions around it. Then I looped through the number positions and found if they were touching the area. If they were, that's a part we care about.

## Part 2

I found all the gears and looped through all of them. I found the parts that were in their adjancency areas and if there were two I return them. Then we multiply the two numbers together and add it all up.
