# Day 1: Trebuchet?!

## Part 1

Seems to be an okay start...fetching the numbers out of text and finding the first and last one

## Part 2

Seems to be a lot harder unless I'm being thick! I used string replacing to replace "one" for 1 etc, except it needs to happen for the first and last because of things like "eightwo", so ordering is also important. This should also be 82 and not 88 as I was initially doing, as in the numbers are not consuming the text.
Hopefully not a sign of things to come because I won't get far this year if these are already tricky!

The regex version is a lot easier to understand, maybe I should have started with that.
