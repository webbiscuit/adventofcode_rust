# Day 5: If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer

## Part 1

Looks fiddly rather than hard. Started with the parsing, and I'm enjoying nom a lot. Much nicer than regex! Then created some helper functions to lookup the map at various places and we're good. Oh! These are u64s not u32s so that was funny.

## Part 2

Aha interesting, this is changing the parsing rather than the calculation. Nice twist!
