# Day 11 Hill Climbing Algorithm

## Part 1

Urgh, some path finding hell. I pulled in an astar library so it feels a bit like cheating (may as well pull in an aoc day 12 lib). I need to get better at this stuff.

## Part 2

Like part 1 but with multiple start positions. Not too bad after all the part 1 wrestling is out the way.
