# Day 9 Rope Bridge

## Part 1

In which we simulate a rope moving around. This wasn't too bad! The head of the rope leads the tail. The only funky thing is when it moves diagonally away and we have to move it twice. We count the number of unique positions the tail of the rope has been in using a HashSet.

## Part 2

Argh! This proper made my brain melt and I had to draw this at some of the early steps to see what's going off. But it's the generic version of Part 1 and quite a nice problem. It's a small algorithm to create some pretty complex shapes.
