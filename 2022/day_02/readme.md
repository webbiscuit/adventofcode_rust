# Day 2 Rock Paper Scissors

## Part 1

In which we play a game of rock paper scissors and use a weird scoring method. This might actually make RPS a bit more interesting because different shapes have different scores so will change the optimal "always do random" strategy. But it probably wouldn't.

## Part 2

In which we play a game of rock paper scissors with a different play to win/lose/draw strategy. Interesting how this gave me less points! I wonder if the elves have an agenda. The hardest thing about this was naming the functions and finally settled on what_beats, what_is_beaten_by, beats_other for the various hand shapes and it was really easy to get those things backwards. But it has a nice API now.
