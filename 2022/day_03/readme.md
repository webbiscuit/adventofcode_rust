# Day 3 Rucksack Reorganization

## Part 1

In which we find the common items in a list of characters split in two. We can do with with a set intersection. There's one of these every year.

## Part 2

In which we find the common items in three lines of characters. A lot like the first part really! Got to use .chunks to grab 3 items at a time which was nice.
