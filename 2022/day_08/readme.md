# Day 8 Treetop Tree House

## Part 1

In which we detect the visibility of trees in a grid. Every year we have to do stuff on 2d grids and points so we knew this was coming! This wasn't too bad. I used a long vector of numbers instead of a vector of vectors because they I find that a bit nicer to work with if you encapsulate the indexing in get set functions.

## Part 2

This one is harder, I think I need to return all the heights in all directions (instead of just counts) and filter on that list, but I'm a bit tired now so I'll do that later.
