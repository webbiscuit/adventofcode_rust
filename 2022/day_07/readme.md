# Day 6 No Space Left On Device

## Part 1

In which we implement the linux filesystem. There's 2 big parts to this: parsing the file commands which is kinda fun, then iterating through all the folders and adding up the file sizes which is a bit of a pain. This might have been better done with a recursive function, but my brain was hurting too much.

## Part 2

A lot easier after all the hard work in part 1, just a lot of complicated calculations to understand and numbers coming in from all over the place. I am not proud of this code.
