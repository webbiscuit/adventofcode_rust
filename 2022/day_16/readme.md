# Day 14: Regolith Reservoir

## Part 1

In which we build a sand simulator. This one was fun! If I had lots of time and energy this would be a great one to animate!

## Part 2

We simulate more sand. This takes a long time to run so there's probably a better way to simulate this. I set the x boundaries to +/- half the height around the spawner which should be enough to capture all the sand (?) rather than the infinity in the puzzle. But there's probably a better way to do this.
