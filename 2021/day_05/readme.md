# Day 5

## Part 1

Need to read the question properly, I accidently solved part 2 first! Tricky bit was finding the points between the line, I initially was thinking around line equations `y = mx + b` but that was too complex.
First use of hashmap in rust, was quite a nice experience. 

## Part 2

I'd done too much in part 1 so this was solved by creating a new grid that counted diagonals.
